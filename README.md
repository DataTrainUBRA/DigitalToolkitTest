# About Us

## Training in Research Data Management and Data Science

The Data Train Program is designed to equip early-career researchers and students with essential skills in research data management and data science. The program is divided into multiple “tracks” to accommodate a variety of learning needs.

The program starts with an overview lecture series – the "Starter Track" – from January to June on various disciplines improving your data skills. It is initiated each January with an official Kick-off Event and Get-together. From July to December each year, the two Operator Tracks alternate, i.e. the "Data Steward" and the "Data Scientist", which are composed of hands-on workshops using diverse computational analysis methods. We also regularly offer "Data Stories", which are invited talks from industry and academia.



## Digital Toolkit Test

As part of the Data Train program, a curated digital learning catalog - the “Digital Toolkit” is being developed to provide long-term support to aspiring researchers, research assistants, and advanced students in the fields of data science, research data management, and digital methods. The aim of the Digital Toolkit is to provide a central, freely accessible, high-quality collection of selected digital self-learning materials that both complement the existing Data Train courses and enable independent, flexible, and needs-based online learning.
