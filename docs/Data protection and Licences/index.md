 #   Data protection and licences

Data protection involves a set of laws and principles to safeguard personal information, while data licensing is a contractual agreement that permits the use of specific datasets.
In the UK, many organizations must pay an annual "data protection fee" to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)
as a form of a license to process personal data, while data licensing involves obtaining permission from the data owner to use that data.
