# Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and act without being explicitly programmed. Here are some essential basics you should know:

## 1. Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a machine learning approach where a model is trained to analyze inputs and predict outcomes based on labeled outputs.

- **Dataset:** Consists of inputs and known outputs (labels).
- **Algorithms:** Examples include linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.
- **Applications:** Spam email detection, image classification.

## 2. Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning aims to discover patterns or structures in data without labeled outputs.

- **Clustering:** Grouping data points based on similarities, e.g., K-Means algorithm.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Simplifying data representation, e.g., Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- **Applications:** Customer segmentation, anomaly detection.

## 3. Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is based on the principle of reward and punishment. An agent learns to optimize its decisions by receiving positive or negative feedback.

- **Agent:** The primary actor interacting within an environment.
- **Reward:** Feedback for correct or incorrect decisions.
- **Applications:** Game control, autonomous vehicles.

Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field with a wide range of applications and techniques that are continuously advancing and have the potential to revolutionize many industries.
