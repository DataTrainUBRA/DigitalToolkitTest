# *What is big data?*

Big data refers to massive, complex data sets that traditional data management systems cannot handle.
When properly collected, managed and analyzed, big data can help organizations discover new insights and make better business decisions.

While enterprise organizations have long collected data, the arrival of the internet and other connected technologies 
significantly increased the volume and variety of data available, birthing the concept of “big data.”

Today, businesses collect large amounts of data—often measured in terabytes or petabytes—on everything from customer transactions and 
social media impressions to internal processes and proprietary research.
Over the past decade, this information has fueled digital transformation across industries. In fact,
big data has earned the nickname “the new oil” for its role driving business growth and innovation.
Data science and, more specifically, big data analytics help organizations make sense of big data’s large and diverse data sets.
These fields use advanced tools such as machine learning to uncover patterns, extract insights and predict outcomes. 
In recent years, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning has further increased the focus on big data.
These systems rely on large, high-quality datasets to train models and improve predictive algorithms.
